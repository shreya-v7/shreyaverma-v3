    content: `You know that feeling when you see a course title and your brain goes "YES I NEED THIS" but also "I'm going to spend the entire semester in a state of panic"? Same. Let me tell you about my toxic relationship with CMU course descriptions.

It starts innocently enough. I'm scrolling through course catalogs, minding my own business, when suddenly I see it: "Machine Learning in Production." My heart does this weird flutter thing. Not the good kind. The "oh no, I need to learn this but also I'm going to fail" kind.

Here's the thing: I LOVE the tech. I genuinely do. The idea of deploying ML models at scale? Building systems that actually matter? Understanding the entire pipeline from training to serving? That's the stuff that makes me excited about being in tech. But then reality hits.

The course description reads like a checklist of everything I don't know yet. Distributed systems. Model serving. A/B testing. Monitoring. Edge cases. Production-grade code. And suddenly, my excitement turns into this overwhelming wave of "I'm not smart enough for this."

The anxiety doesn't just appear and disappear. Oh no. It's a whole semester-long journey. Week 1: "I can do this! I'm excited!" Week 2: "Wait, what did they just say?" Week 3: "I'm definitely going to fail." Week 4: "Maybe if I just read everything three times..." And it goes on.

By mid-semester, I'm in full panic mode. Every assignment feels like a test of whether I actually belong in tech. Every lecture is a reminder of how much I don't know. Every project makes me question if I'm cut out for this.

But here's the wild part: by the end of the semester, something shifts. I've learned more than I thought possible. I've built things I didn't think I could build. I've survived. And I'm not just surviving - I'm actually understanding it.

The anxiety doesn't completely disappear, but it transforms. It becomes this weird mix of "I still don't know everything" (spoiler: no one does) and "but I know more than I did before, and that's enough."

So here's my take: if you see a course that makes you feel both excited and terrified, take it. The anxiety is temporary. The knowledge? That sticks around. And honestly, being a little overwhelmed means you're pushing yourself, and that's where the real growth happens.

Plus, by the time the semester ends, you'll have a whole new set of skills and a story about how you survived something that felt impossible. And that's pretty cool, right? 🚀`
